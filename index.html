    - Create a new web page for an animal shelter. List out the animals available to be adopted, including pictures and descriptions of each animal. Have at least 3-5 animals listed. Don't forget to set up a git repository, make frequent commits and push to a remote repository on GitHub.
    - Display each animal's "profile" in a column.
    - Change the styles of elements nested within the columns using the idea of cascading.
    - Find other places in your web pages where you can change elements on the page according to cascading precedence.
    - Center some elements on the page.
